## Setup

### Load packages

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(statsr)
```

### Load data

Make sure your data and R Markdown files are in the same directory. When loaded
your data file will be called `gss`. Delete this note when before you submit 
your work. 

```{r load-data}
load("gss.Rdata")

## Part 1: Data

**How the observations in the sample are collected:**

Each survey from 1972 to 2004 was an independently drawn sample of English-speaking persons 18  years of age or over, living in non-institutional arrangements within the United States.Starting in 2006 Spanish-speakers were added to the target population.

Block quota sampling was used in surveys from 1972 to 1976. Full probability sampling was employed fully from 1977 onwards up to 2014.

**Implications of this data collection method on the scope of inference (generalizability):**

Since the data collection involves random sampling, the sample can be considered representative of the population. Hence findings from this observational study can be generalized to the entire population.

**Implications of this data collection method on the scope of inference (causality):**

Since this is an observational study, not an experiment where subjects are randomly assigned for specific treatments, hence, the findings on relationship among different factors only establish association but do not imply causality.

## Part 2: Research question

**Research quesion: According "The World Factbook" by CIA, the estimated mother's average age at first birth in 2011 for the United States is 25.6. Does the GSS survey provide convincing evidence that the mother's average age at first birth of the population in 2012 is equal to 25.6?**

This research question is of interest because mother's average age at first birth is an useful indicator for gauging the success of family planning programs aiming to reduce maternal mortality, increase contraceptive use - particularly among married and unmarried adolescents, delay age at first marriage, and improve the health of newborns.
